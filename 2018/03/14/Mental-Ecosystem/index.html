    	<p>Humans have an awfuly hard time finding their routine and place in the world. I remeber going to my friends houses as a kid, and just being lost. The whole enviroment seemed so radically different then my own, and each were radically different from each other. It is hard to describe exactly what was different though, all the same elements where there. The living room, dining room, bedroom; mother, father, siblings; toys, snacks, and dinner. Yet the differences of each element built up an enviroment that was entirly unique.<br>As I now find myself at college and living on my own. It is a lot more difficult than I imagined to build an enviroment that suits my needs. More than the actual physically objects, my bed and food, it is the routines. Creating daily and weekly routines that  are balanced. While building stressful activities into my routine like homework I also need to build in areas where I can relax, or else the stress builds up until it needs to be released and often demolatious my homework and other activites that are required.<br>I still canâ€™t explain why differences in enviroments between individuals is so radical, but I now know that they are all required to be balanced.</p>

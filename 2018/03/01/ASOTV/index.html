    	<p>Our society is overwellmingly influence by TV. Humans are designed to socialize and conform, for a number of reasons. A couple being if there is a desease going through the community we can be aware and learn from those around us how to avoid it. We also conform so that we can be accepted into the society and therefore get the benifits of being part of a community. But these human behaviors that are helpful within small communites have adverse effects in today’s society.</p>
<p>Let’s take the news for example, the human behavior is to watch the news so that we can adjust our behavior to prepare for what we see. The only problem is that news by definition are things that don’t commonly happen. Everytime there is a plane crash we will happen we will hear about it, leading to people to become very afraid riding in a plane because to thier brain plane crashes happen all the time. But rarely will you hear about car crashes in the news because they happen constantly, leading people rarely being afraid of riding in a car even though it is orders of magnitude more dangerous than riding in a plane.</p>
<p>People don’t know how real relationships work anymore. I know several girls who are just waiting for the perfect guy to come their way, because that is always how it happens on TV. From our childhood we have watched countless times how the couple falls in love and has their happily ever after within the space of two hours. Our human brain keeps on trying to model and act out this script, but it never works out. We don’t even know what is supposed to come after happily ever after.</p>
<p>I have began to actually hate movies and TV, because of how badly they represent the complexity of human iteractions, but I’ll go into that another time. Also I’m going to start refering to the irrational human behaviors caused by TV as ASOTV <em>(pronounced asotiv)</em> short for “As seen on TV”. Cause how many other places have you seen human behavior changed by TV?</p>

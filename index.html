    	<p>Humans have an awfuly hard time finding their routine and place in the world. I remeber going to my friends houses as a kid, and just being lost. The whole enviroment seemed so radically different then my own, and each were radically different from each other. It is hard to describe exactly what was different though, all the same elements where there. The living room, dining room, bedroom; mother, father, siblings; toys, snacks, and dinner. Yet the differences of each element built up an enviroment that was entirly unique.<br>As I now find myself at college and living on my own. It is a lot more difficult than I imagined to build an enviroment that suits my needs. More than the actual physically objects, my bed and food, it is the routines. Creating daily and weekly routines that  are balanced. While building stressful activities into my routine like homework I also need to build in areas where I can relax, or else the stress builds up until it needs to be released and often demolatious my homework and other activites that are required.<br>I still can’t explain why differences in enviroments between individuals is so radical, but I now know that they are all required to be balanced.</p>

    	<p>Our society is overwhelmingly influence by TV. Humans are designed to socialize and conform, for a number of reasons. If there is a disease going through the community we can learn from those around us how to avoid it. Humans also conform to what they seen in the society so that they can be accepted and get the benefits of being part of a community. But these human behaviors that are helpful within small communities have adverse effects in today’s society.</p>
<p>Let’s take the news for example, the human behavior is to watch the news so that we can adjust our behavior to prepare for what is around us. The only problem is that news by definition are things that don’t commonly happen, especially when the news covers millions of people. Every time there is a plane crash we will happen we will hear about it, leading to people to become very afraid riding in a plane because to their brain plane crashes happen all the time. But rarely will you hear about car crashes in the news because they happen constantly, leading people to rarely be afraid of cars even though it is orders of magnitude more dangerous than a plane.</p>
<p>People don’t know how real relationships work anymore. I know several girls who are just waiting for the perfect guy to come their way, because that is always how it happens on TV. From our childhood we have watched countless times how the couple falls in love and has their happily ever after within the space of two hours. Our human brain keeps on trying to model and act out this script, but it never works out. We don’t even know what is supposed to come after happily ever after.</p>
<p>I have began to actually hate movies and TV, because of how badly they represent the complexity of human iterations, but I’ll go into that another time. Also I’m going to start referring to the irrational human behaviors caused by TV as ASOTV <em>(pronounced asotiv)</em> short for “As seen on TV”. Cause how many other places have you seen human behavior influenced by TV?</p>

    	<p>I am bad at buses, I get on the bus or subway or train and there are so many people I freak out. But it’s not because i’m scared of crowds, it’s because I love analysing people. There are so many people, and everyone is on the bus for such a wide range of reasons that it is too much for my brain to calculate and I begin to freak out.</p>
<p>Normal crowds are easier. School events, concerts, New York streets. It is much easier to generalize because the events contain a very similar type of people. Similar age and background. But public transportation even though there is a lot less people then a crowd everyone is so diverse. There are very few attributes that the majority share.</p>
<p>I love emulating people, climbing behind their eyes and calculating what they are thinking. But with so many people it becomes overwelling to calculate such diverse brains especially ones that are so different than mine, and their interaction with others.</p>
<p>If my brain were a computer you would hear the fans turning on high, and the disks spinning their fastest when I climb onto a bus. I have had to just turn on music and just close my eyes, and even then it is hard to get my brain to slow down.</p>
<p>So if I lose all of my motor skills in a crowd, now you know why. My question is just why don’t you?</p>
